This is my implementation of transformations like translation,rotation and scaling and my own implementation of glulookat().(which in my code is mylookat()).

Control keys:
1)a/A-moves camera along current look direction
2)x/X-moves the camera position along x
3)y/Y-moves the camera position along y
4)z/Z-moves the camera position along z
5)i/I-rotate camera about look vector
6)j/J-rotate camera about v vector
7)k/K-rotate camera about u vector
8)e/E-changes camera target in x
9)r/R-changes camera target in y
10)t/T-changes camera target in z
11)u/U-rotation about world axis-x
12)v/V-rotation about world axis-y
13)w/W-rotation about world axis-z
14)+/-:zoom
15)Arrow keys-translation in x & y
16)Home and End-translation in z
17)F1/F2-rotate about body x
18)F3/F4-rotate about body y
19)F5/F6-rotate about body z
20)n/N:change camera upx
21)m/M:change camera upy
22)l/L:change camera upz


For other mesh models google BrownMesh.This code can be used to view and transform other models.

For running the code type make at terminal.Then type at terminal>>./viewer teapot.ifs

Happy Coding :)
